	<h1> My Autobiography</h1>
My name is An-Ru Cheng, and I am a junior at National Tsing Hua University, currently studying Foreign Languages and Literature. I set up this website as a project for my bilingual web design class, and I am going to share some classical artworks along with my interpretation of them on here.

I am going to share a bit about myself. I grew up in Taipei and all my schools before university are within the same district, so home has always been my favorite safe place to be. However, I absolutely love travelling and experience different lifestyles, and I also like the unplanned surprises every trip brought about.  
   
Growing up I have always love to draw and paint whenever I have free time, so you cannot find a textbook of mine without doodles on it. My favorite drawing method is academic drawing, which is a more structural approach to drawing. The reason why I chose to learn this method is because it provides a set of systematic rules, on which you can add your creativity, and to me this adds depth to an artwork. Contrary to common belief, art does have right and wrong.

 Art has always interested me because I think everyone can feel a surge of emotion when looking at certain artworks, without even knowing anything about it. Thus, I hope, through introducing all types of artwork, this website can be a place where all the audience can feel a sense of connection.

我是程安如，目前正就讀於國立清華大學的外國語文學系。這個網站是為了一門雙語網頁設計課程而架設，而我將會在這裡介紹許多經典的畫作及藝術品，並分享我對其的解讀及分析。

我從小在台北長大且求學期間都是大致在同一區，因此家一直是我最慣於待著的地方。儘管如此我很仍喜歡四處旅遊，去體驗各種新鮮的生活模式，而旅途中發生的大小意外，也是旅行吸引我的一大原因。

從小到大我時常利用空閒時光畫畫，所以我基本上每本課本都有著許多塗鴉。我最喜歡的作畫方式是學院派藝術的畫法，那是以一個比較有系統性的架構去畫畫的方式。我覺得如果有個固定架構作為基底，並再增添自己的創意及特色，那創造出來的藝術品就會更有深度且更耐人尋味。

藝術一直以來都很吸引我的一大原因是，我覺得藝術可以激起每個觀賞者的特定情緒，儘管我們對那件藝術品毫無了解，因此我希望透過介紹各種流派的作品，每個點進來的人都可以感受到與這個網站有著一絲連結。
