	<p>Artist: Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino ; Raphael</p>
	<p>Work of art: Transfiguration</p>
	<p>Year: 1516–20</p>

		In the upper half of this work, Jesus is floating above a hill in the clouds. the bottom half of it, is a crowd gesturing towards Jesus. The two halfs of this painting contrasts with each other, for the upper part is bright, while the bottom part is in the dark. From my personal experience of struggling to follow the classical ways of drawing, I learned that bringing light to a canvas is very hard. For example, in this painting, Raphael did not just paint the upper part with brighter colors to show its light, but made every single corners of the painting reflect the light, such as the clothing of the crowd. Through the reflecting of light, can our eyes believe Jesus is floating in the light. I am therefore very impressed by this work, and the only thing I find problem with is position of Jesus's arms. Of all the majestic gestures to choose from, Raphael chose this position, which I think is a bit awkward.
