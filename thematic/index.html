	<h1>The topic for my thematic website</h1>
	<p> The topic for my website will be to share some artworks and short literary works. The content will include the background and analysis of the art and literary works. They will be categorized by their genres and all the genres will be listed on the left of the website page. To make the website less boring, when clicking on each artwork,  memes that are related to those works will pop out.
